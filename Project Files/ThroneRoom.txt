"""You open the door marked with the throne and find yourself (Rather predictably) in the main throne room of the palace.
At the far east end of the room lays the monarchs throne, fallen onto its side and missing the golden furnishings that marked it as the seat of the king.
Next to it in a similarly ruined state lays the seat of the monarch’s wife, it too has had all that made it valuable removed.
Oil Lamps (use oillamp to interact with these) line the walls, they too are unlit but still contain a small amount of oil, left behind by looters.
A tattered and faded red carpet stretches from the eastern door up to the thrones themselves.
To the West is the door to the main entrance room.
In the North Eastern corner of the room, behind both thrones, is a door with a cooking pot engraved onto it."""
