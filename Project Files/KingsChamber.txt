"""You exit the secret passage and enter the kings chamber from behind a banner which bears the family crest.
The room appeared to once be the grandest in the entire palace, however now it stands in ruin with all items of value torn out and the chests looted.
A large bed sits facing along the centre of the northern wall, facing the rooms southern entrance.
Two paintings remain, likely un-looted due to the damage present on the artwork.
One hangs directly across from the passage and shows the entire royal family, the monarch with his wife by his side and their two children standing in front.
The second painting hangs above the large bed along the northern wall.
A small section of wall within the painting is missing, however the damage does not look to be due to age or looting.
In the south west corner there are 3 fragments matching the design of the walls piled one on top of the other.
Their size and shapes match that of the damage within the painting but each has a unique design painted onto it.
Use “look tile1” to view the first and “take tile1” to take it.
Use “look tile2” to view the second and “take tile2” to take it.
Use “look tile3” to view the third and “take tile3” to take it.
The large door leading back to the main room is locked even from the inside, no keyhole is visible"""
