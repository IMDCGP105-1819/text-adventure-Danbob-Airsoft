"""The door gives a loud creek as you pass through into what was clearly once a storage chamber for palace supplies.
However, time and looting have left very few items in the room.
A large central shelfing unit runs down the centre of the room while wall mounted shelfs run along the two side walls.
A small carpet sits under part of the shelf, its corner crumpled to reveal part of a small hidden hole.
Nothing remains on the central shelf while the side shelfs are covered in the crumbs of food and shards of wood.
The only door to this room leads back into the main entrance area to the west."""
