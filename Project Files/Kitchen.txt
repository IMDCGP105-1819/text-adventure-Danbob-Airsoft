"""With a small ammount of force you open the door into the palace’s kitchen area.
Metal pots, pans and other cooking equipment are scattered around the room both across the many worktops and around the floor.
Small remains of food are strewn across the floor, too old for even the rats to eat at this time.
The only missing items from the room are large, sharp preparation knifes and the monarch’s famous solid gold cutlery.
On the ground by the door is a small box of Matches.
To the south is the door back into the throne room.
A small crate sits in a gap between the work stations on the western wall. It looks considerably less weathered and damaged than its surroundings."""
